# osm_almostjunction
---
This repository is part of the ***Almost Junctions*** case study, conducted by Sam Try, as part of the Spatial IT Project “**Analysis of Topological Quality Assurance Rules for OpenStreetMap (OSM)**”, under supervision of Dr. Martin Tomko and Dr. Ivan Majic, at the University of Melbourne, in May 2019.

This project addressed the question: **how topological constraints on OpenStreetMap (OSM) are translated and implemented in existing rule-based error detection tools, for a case study on ‘almost junction’**. This project focuses on road features only, which is equivalent to the OSM features with ‘highway’ tags (i.e., excluding other linear features such as railway, waterway, power lines, etc.).

The SQL scripts was re-constructed in SQL language to be executed in PostgreSQL database (version 11) with PostGIS (version 2.5). It was based on a simplified workflow of ‘Almost Junction’ rule by Osmose and KeepRight. More details can be found in the header of each file.
